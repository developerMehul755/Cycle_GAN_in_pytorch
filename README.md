# Cycle_GAN_in_pytorch
This repos contain the code of cycle gan implemented from scratch in pytorch. I have accomplished the task of image translation where i have translated the image of horses to zebra by considering the domain of the image of the horse image. Cycle gan used when we donot have paired dataset and this works very well even if we fed it unpaired data.
